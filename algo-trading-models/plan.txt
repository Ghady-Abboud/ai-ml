Title: "Investigating the predictive power of technical indicators for short-term equity price movements using ensemble learning methods and rigorous time-series cross-validation"

PHASE 1: Foundation & Baseline (Week 1)
Status: ~80% done - just needs ML completion Deliverables:
✅ Data pipeline (503 S&P 500 stocks, 6 years)
✅ Feature engineering (15 technical indicators)
✅ Baseline strategies (Naive +46.3%, Random -0.5%)
✅ Label creation
⏳ First ML model (Logistic Regression)

PHASE 2: Model Development & Validation (Week 2-3)
Goal: Build 5 models, compare rigorously, select best Models to Implement:
Logistic Regression (interpretable baseline)
Random Forest (ensemble, feature importance)
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost - state of art)
LSTM/RNN (time-series specific, shows DL knowledge)
Ensemble Stacking (meta-learner combining all)
Validation Strategy:
TimeSeriesSplit (40 folds, walk-forward)
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Sharpe Ratio
Statistical significance testing (t-tests vs baseline)
Confusion matrices, ROC curves
Deliverable: Comparison table showing ML beats naive baseline with statistical significance

PHASE 3: Advanced Features & Research Depth (Week 3-4)
This is where you show research chops Feature Engineering 2.0:
Market regime features (VIX, sector rotation)
Cross-sectional features (stock rank within sector)
Alternative data (sentiment from news/Twitter)
Feature selection (SHAP values, permutation importance)
Hyperparameter Optimization:
Grid search / Bayesian optimization
Document best configs per model
Ablation Studies:
Which indicators matter most?
How many days of history needed?
Impact of train/test split size
Deliverable: Research notebook showing systematic experimentation

PHASE 4: Regression & Price Targets (Week 4-5)
Upgrade from classification to actionable predictions Implementation:
Train regression models (predict returns, not just direction)
Combine classification + regression (only predict magnitude if direction confident)
Multi-horizon models (1-day, 3-day, 5-day predictions)
Calibration (does "70% confidence" actually mean 70%?)
Risk Management:
Stop-loss strategies
Position sizing based on prediction confidence
Kelly Criterion for optimal bet sizing
Deliverable: Backtested strategy with risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe >1.5)

PHASE 5: Production System (Week 5-6)
Show you can deploy, not just research Live Inference Pipeline:
Daily data fetch (market close)
Feature computation
Model prediction (load pre-trained)
Signal generation
